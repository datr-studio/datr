# commonr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of commonr is to provide a set of common functions that appear in pretty much all R projects. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of commonr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("firthj/commonr")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r examples}
library(commonr)

## Source all R files in a folder, rather than one by one:
source_folder("R")
```
